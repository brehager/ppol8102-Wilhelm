title: "Cost of Anesthesia Services: Conceptual and Operational Definitions"
output: github_document
---


## Conceptual Definition
The **cost of anesthesia services** refers to the total charges incurred for the administration of anesthesia during medical procedures. This includes fees for the anesthesiologist, anesthesia-related medications, equipment, and other associated costs. The cost may vary depending on factors such as procedure complexity, provider type, geographic location, and insurance reimbursement policies.

## Operational Definition
For this study, the **cost of anesthesia services** is defined as the Medicare reimbursement rate for anesthesia services per procedure, measured in U.S. dollars. The operationalization is from Medicare pricing datasets, where cost is recorded as a continuous variable.
